# Contributing

I'd love for you to help contribute to this project. Before you contribute, please read the following:

1. Feel free to post questions to the issue tracker. This is a pretty small project right now, so I don't mind trying to answer questions there. In the future, this will change.
2. If you find a security bug, please email me at ryan@ryanjm.com.
3. If you have a suggestion, please check out the ROADMAP to see if it isn't already there. If it looks like it would line up with the project's goals, then submit an issue.
4. If you are having an issue, please make sure to include Ruby, Rails, and EventManager versions.
5. Before sending a pull request, please create an issue and make sure it is something we want in the project. Then see Pull Requests the section.
